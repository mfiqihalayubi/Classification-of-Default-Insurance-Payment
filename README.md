<h1>Credit Card Customer Segmentation (Clustering)</h1>

## **Background**


## **Objective**
Create a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of customer insurance credit default status in the next month.

## **About the dataset**

I took the dataset from Google Cloud BigQuery. This dataset contains 2965 entries of Taiwanese customer insurance credit information. The information includes demographic, historical payment, balance, and default status informations.

## **Conclusion**

1. The model is evaluated with a recall matrix because the purpose of this model is to predict people who are likely to default so that we can minimize false negatives. False negative describes a customer who is considered (based on the prediction result) to be able to pay the credit bill in the next month but in reality the customer fails to pay the bill.
   
2. There are 3 models trialed in default mode, namely logistic regression, KNN, and SVM. Of the three models, the logistic regression model has the highest recall value on each predicted dataset (train and test) where the recall value is 1 or 100% for each prediction.
   
3. Of the three models trialed in the default mode, the SVM model was chosen. The reasons are :

  - The recall value produced in the default mode is not too much different from the recall produced by logistic linear (0.97 in the train dataset and 0.96 in the test dataset)
  - Overfitting is not significant because the difference between the recall value generated from the train dataset and the recall value generated from the test dataset is only 0.01. For information, the recall value generated from the train dataset is 0.97 and the recall value generated from the test dataset is 0.96
   
4. The recall value generated by the Polynomial SVM model with the tuning hyperparameters has a value of 1 or 100%, while the recall value generated by the SVM model with the default hyperparameters has a value of 0.96 or 96%. This means that the Polynomial SVM model that uses hyperparameter tuning can increase the recall value by 4% compared to the previous recall value using the default SVM model (RBF kernel), or it can be said that the polynomial SVM model with hyperparameter tuning has a 4% lower error value when predicting customer categories that will experience default

## **Business Recommendation**

1. As the data indicates that credit card ownership declines after the age of 31, developing financial products tailored to younger customers might help increase usage and loyalty. Additionally, products aimed at older customers, such as retirement-focused financial solutions, could be beneficial.
2. With the model’s high recall, particularly after SVM Polynomial hyperparameter tuning, the business can confidently predict potential defaulters. Consider creating preemptive measures such as early intervention programs, personalized payment plans, or targeted communication to those predicted to default.
3. Since the majority of credit card holders have a graduate or bachelor’s degree, these segments should be the primary focus for personalized financial products

## **Model Improvement Recommendation**

1. Regularly update the model with new data to ensure its effectiveness over time. Periodic retraining and hyperparameter tuning can help maintain or improve the model's performance, ensuring that it adapts to any changes in customer behavior or economic conditions
