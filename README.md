<h1>Credit Card Customer Segmentation (Clustering)</h1>

## **Background**


## **Objective**
Create a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of customer insurance credit default status in the next month.

## **About the dataset**

I took the dataset from Google Cloud BigQuery. This dataset contains 2965 entries of Taiwanese customer insurance credit information. The information includes demographic, historical payment, balance, and default status informations.

## **Conclusion**

1. The model is evaluated using the recall metric because the goal is to predict individuals who are likely to default, thereby minimizing false negatives. A false negative occurs when a customer is predicted to be able to pay the credit bill in the next month but fails to do so in reality
   
2. Three models were trialed in default mode: logistic regression, KNN, and SVM. Among these, the logistic regression model achieved the highest recall value on both the training and test datasets, with a recall of 1 (or 100%) for each prediction.
   
3. Despite the logistic regression's high recall, the SVM model was chosen for the following reasons:

  - The recall value produced by the SVM model in default mode is very close to that of the logistic regression (0.97 on the training dataset and 0.96 on the test dataset)
  - Overfitting is not significant, as the difference between the recall values of the training and test datasets is only 0.01. Specifically, the training dataset achieved a recall of 0.97, while the test dataset 
    achieved a recall of 0.96
   
4. The recall value generated by the Polynomial SVM model with tuned hyperparameters is 1 (or 100%), whereas the default SVM model (RBF kernel) produced a recall of 0.96 (or 96%). This indicates that the Polynomial SVM model with hyperparameter tuning improved the recall by 4% compared to the default SVM model. In other words, the Polynomial SVM model with hyperparameter tuning has a 4% lower error rate in predicting customer categories that are likely to default

## **Business Recommendation**

1. As the data indicates that credit card ownership declines after the age of 31, developing financial products tailored to younger customers might help increase usage and loyalty. Additionally, products aimed at older customers, such as retirement-focused financial solutions, could be beneficial
2. With the model’s high recall, particularly after SVM Polynomial hyperparameter tuning, the business can confidently predict potential defaulters. Consider creating preemptive measures such as early intervention programs, personalized payment plans, or targeted communication to those predicted to default
3. Since the majority of credit card holders have a graduate or bachelor’s degree, these segments should be the primary focus for personalized financial products

## **Model Improvement Recommendation**

1. Regularly update the model with new data to ensure its effectiveness over time. Periodic retraining and hyperparameter tuning can help maintain or improve the model's performance, ensuring that it adapts to any changes in customer behavior or economic conditions
